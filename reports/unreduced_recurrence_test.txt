=== UNREDUCED RECURRENCE IMPLEMENTATION ===

Orbit paclet loaded successfully

STEP 1: Verification test (k=0 to 20 - small test)

Running verification test for k=0 to 20
Comparing unreduced recurrence vs reduced (Orbit paclet)...

Computing reduced states...
â Reduced states computed (21 states)
Computing unreduced states...
â Unreduced states computed (21 states)
Verifying state matches...
  Verified k=0/20
  Verified k=20/20
States compared: 21
All states match? â YES
â Verification passed! Unreduced recurrence is correct.

STEP 2: Valuation tracking with pattern detection

Primes to analyze: {3, 5, 7, 11}
kMax: 100


>>> PRIME p=3 <<<
Tracking valuations for p=3 up to k=100
  Generating unreduced states...
