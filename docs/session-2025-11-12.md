# Session Summary: November 12, 2025

## Overview

This session focused on archiving and documenting the Chebyshev-Pell square root rationalization framework and the beautiful "Infinite Interference" visualization discovery.

## Major Accomplishments

### 1. Square Root Rationalization Module (v0.4.0)

**Added**: `Orbit/Kernel/SquareRootRationalizations.wl`

Extracted and systematized work from the egypt repository on using Chebyshev polynomials and Pell equations for high-precision rational approximations to square roots.

**Key algorithms**:
- `PellSolution[d]` - Wildberger's efficient Pell equation solver
- `ChebyshevTerm[x, k]` - Egyptian fraction terms at Pell solution
- `sqrttrf[d, n, m]` - Fast refinement using ChebyshevU ratio
- `nestqrt[d, n0, {m1, m2}]` - Nested iteration for explosive convergence

**Mathematical insight**: Chebyshev terms are always rational (depend only on integer x), but Pell solutions are unique integer points where y (from unit norm $x^2 - dy^2 = 1$) is also rational. At non-Pell x, maintaining unit norm requires irrational y, making the result irrational when dividing by y.

### 2. Performance Breakthrough

**Fair benchmark results** (sqrt(13)):

| Iterations | Precision | Our Time | Mathematica Time | Speedup |
|------------|-----------|----------|------------------|---------|
| 3 | 3,111 digits | 0.011s | 0.063s | **5.8x** |
| 4 | 31,131 digits | 0.015s | 22.5s | **1548x** |
| 5 | 311,325 digits | 0.252s | >6 min (timeout) | **>1400x** |

**Convergence rate**: ~10x precision per iteration (vs 2x for Newton/Rationalize)

**Key properties discovered**:
- All Chebyshev terms positive → monotone increasing → guaranteed lower bound
- Egyptian fraction approach always approaches from below (unlike CF which oscillates)
- Pell base gives ~3x convergence advantage over crude starting point

**Important context**:
- Compared against Mathematica's Rationalize (CF-based)
- When implemented in FLINT (C), FLINT's native sqrt still wins (decades of optimization)
- BUT beats Mathematica significantly for high-precision rational approximation

### 3. Chebyshev Visualization: "Infinite Interference"

**Discovered**: Family of curves inscribed in unit circle

**Formula**:
```mathematica
subnrefu[x_, k_] := ChebyshevT[k + 1, x] - x ChebyshevT[k, x]
```

**Properties**:
- Touches unit circle at exactly k+1 points (regular polygon vertices)
- Contact points rotated by **-π/(2k)** from standard position
- Unit integral norm: ∫|f_k| dθ = 1 for all k
- Creates beautiful n-star patterns

**Explicit angle formula**:
```mathematica
circpf[k_] := Table[
  Through[{Cos, Sin}[-π/(2k) + π/k·i]],
  {i, 0, 2k-1}
]
```

**Shadertoy implementation**: https://www.shadertoy.com/view/MXc3Rj

**Complex number formulation** (GLSL):
$$f_k(x) = \frac{(-1)^k \cdot i\sqrt{1-x^2}}{2} \left[(1 - 2x^2 - 2ix\sqrt{1-x^2})^k - (1 - 2x^2 + 2ix\sqrt{1-x^2})^k\right]$$

Binet-like formula using conjugate differences that automatically produces real-valued Chebyshev polynomial relationships.

## Technical Insights

### Imaginary Cancellation Trick

The sqrttrf formula uses ChebyshevU with imaginary arguments:
$$U_m\left(\sqrt{\frac{d}{-(n^2-d)}}\right)$$

Despite the square root of negative producing complex values, the **ratio** of two such ChebyshevU polynomials is algebraically real. The `Simplify` operation eliminates imaginary parts automatically.

### Lower Bound Proof

At Pell solution $(x, y)$, all Chebyshev terms $T_k(x-1) > 0$. Since base $b = (x-1)/y < \sqrt{d}$ and we add only positive terms:
$$\text{approx} = b \left(1 + \sum_{k=1}^{n} T_k(x-1)\right)$$

This forms a **monotone increasing sequence** converging from below to $\sqrt{d}$.

For interval arithmetic or certified bounds, this framework offers more control than standard CF-based methods.

### Rotation Angle Insight

The -π/(2k) offset rotates the regular (k+1)-gon by half its exterior angle, creating the optimal symmetric arrangement where Chebyshev polynomials naturally touch the unit circle. This is NOT arbitrary - it's intrinsic to the polynomial structure.

## Connections Across Topics
