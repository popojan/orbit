## King's Chamber Dimensions

The King's Chamber is a remarkable Pythagorean cuboid:

| Dimension | Value (cubits) | Decimal |
|-----------|----------------|---------|
| Length | 20 | 20.0 |
| Width | 10 | 10.0 |
| Height | √125 = 5√5 | 11.18 |
| End wall diagonal | 15 | 15.0 |
| Space diagonal | 25 | 25.0 |

**Pythagorean relationships:**
```
10² + (5√5)² = 100 + 125 = 225 = 15²    (end wall)
10² + 20² + 125 = 100 + 400 + 125 = 625 = 25²    (space diagonal)
```

**Key observation:** The height involves **√5**, the same irrational that appears in the golden ratio φ = (1+√5)/2.

### Metric equivalents (Petrie)
- Length: 10.45 m
- Width: 5.20 m
- Height: 5.80 m

### Floor level
82.03-82.14 cubits above pyramid base (Petrie).

## Internal Shaft Angles

### Queen's Chamber Shafts

| Shaft | Angle | Slope ratio |
|-------|-------|-------------|
| Northern | 37°28' - 39.1° | ~9/11 |
| Southern | 38°28' | ~9/11 |

**Note:** Slope **9/11** shares denominator with exterior ratio **7/11**.

### King's Chamber Shafts

| Shaft | Angle | Slope ratio | Notes |
|-------|-------|-------------|-------|
| Southern | 45°13' | **1/1** | Points toward Orion's Belt |
| Northern | 31-32.6° | **7/11** | Same as exterior! |

**Remarkable:** The northern shaft has slope **7/11** — identical to the pyramid's exterior height/base ratio!

### Grand Gallery / Ascending Passage

| Passage | Angle | Slope ratio |
|---------|-------|-------------|
| Ascending Passage | 26°26'46" | **1/2** |
| Grand Gallery | 26.3° | **1/2** |
| Descending Passage | 26.3° | **1/2** |

## The Shaft Mystery

### Discovery History

| Year | Explorer | Discovery |
|------|----------|-----------|
| 1872 | Waynman Dixon | First discovered Queen's Chamber shafts |
| 1993 | Rudolf Gantenbrink (Upuaut) | Found "Gantenbrink's Door" — limestone + 2 copper pins |
| 2002 | National Geographic | Drilled through door; found second door behind |
| 2011 | Djedi Project (Leeds) | Snake camera found red hieroglyphs |

### Key findings from Djedi Project (2011)

- **Red hieroglyphs** behind the door (never seen by humans since construction)
- Copper "handles" are **decorative**, not functional
- Door's reverse side is **polished** — intentional placement, not debris block
- Hieroglyphs remain undeciphered

### Physical characteristics

- Shaft openings: 21 × 21 cm (8.4" × 8.4")
- Queen's Chamber southern shaft length: 59.4 m to blocking stone
- Both blocking stones at same relative position (~208 feet from chamber)

## Rational Structure Summary

| Element | Ratio | Denominator |
|---------|-------|-------------|
| Exterior height/base | **7/11** | 11 |
| Queen's Chamber shafts | **9/11** | 11 |
| King's Chamber N shaft | **7/11** | 11 |
| King's Chamber S shaft | **1/1** | 1 |
| Passages | **1/2** | 2 |

The prevalence of **11** as denominator is striking.

## The √5 Connection

Both the exterior and interior geometry involve √5:

| Location | Appearance of √5 |
|----------|------------------|
| Exterior ratio 7/11 | Approximates √φ/2 = √((1+√5)/2)/2 |
| King's Chamber height | Exactly 5√5 cubits |

**Speculation:** Did the Egyptians have deeper knowledge of √5 geometry than documented?

## Future Exploration

- Decipher the red hieroglyphs behind Gantenbrink's Door
- Analyze Queen's Chamber dimensions for similar patterns
- Check if other chambers follow rational slope patterns
- Investigate the "Big Void" discovered by muon tomography (2017)
