## The Forgotten Pioneer: N. S. Aladov (1896)

In February 1894, an otherwise unknown mathematician submitted a paper to *Matematicheskii Sbornik*, the journal of the Moscow Mathematical Society. The paper, titled in French as *"Sur la distribution des résidus quadratiques et non-quadratiques d'un nombre premier P dans la suite 1, 2, ..., P-1"* (On the distribution of quadratic residues and non-residues of a prime P in the sequence 1, 2, ..., P-1), was published two years later in 1896.

The author was **N. S. Aladov**. Beyond the initials and this single publication, almost nothing is known about him.

**What we know:**
- Paper received: February 20, 1894
- Published: *Mat. Sb.* **18** (1896), pp. 61–75
- Language: Russian (with French title, as was customary)
- Content: Exact formulas for counting consecutive quadratic residue patterns

**Source:** [Math-Net.Ru archive](http://mi.mathnet.ru/eng/msb/v18/i1/p61)

Despite his obscurity, Aladov's work established the foundation for an entire field. He proved exact formulas showing that the count of consecutive quadratic residue patterns depends on the prime modulo 4—a result that would be rediscovered and extended by others over the following decades.

## The Chebyshev Connection

The timing of Aladov's paper is remarkable. **Pafnuty Lvovich Chebyshev** (1821–1894), the towering figure of Russian mathematics, died on December 8, 1894—just ten months after Aladov's paper was received.

Chebyshev's 1849 doctoral dissertation *"Teoria sravneny"* (Theory of Congruences) included an appendix specifically on quadratic residues. This work, which earned a prize from the St. Petersburg Academy of Sciences, established the Russian tradition in this area of number theory.

**Key dates:**
- 1849: Chebyshev's dissertation on congruences with appendix on quadratic residues
- February 20, 1894: Aladov's paper received
- December 8, 1894: Chebyshev dies in St. Petersburg
- 1896: Aladov's paper published

Aladov was thus working at the very end of the Chebyshev era, on a topic that Chebyshev himself had pioneered forty-five years earlier.

## Two Mathematical Schools

### The Moscow School

The Moscow Mathematical Society was founded on **September 15, 1864** by **Nikolai Dmitrievich Brashman** (1796–1866). Brashman, born in Rassnova near Brünn (now Brno, Czech Republic), had been professor of applied mathematics at Moscow University since 1834.

The Society initially had only 14 members. One of them was Chebyshev—the only member holding a position outside Moscow.

Brashman founded the journal *Matematicheskii Sbornik* in 1866, the same year he died. The journal's first issue opened with his portrait and biography.

### The St. Petersburg School

Chebyshev, though a founding member of the Moscow Society, had moved to St. Petersburg in 1847 and established his own school there. The St. Petersburg school became known for its algorithmic, concrete approach to mathematics, in contrast to the more abstract Moscow tradition that would develop later.

Chebyshev's students and intellectual descendants—Korkin, Zolotarev, Markov, Voronoi, and eventually Vinogradov—formed the "St. Petersburg School of Number Theory."

### A Curious Position

Aladov published in the *Moscow* journal (*Mat. Sb.*), yet his topic—quadratic residues—was quintessentially *St. Petersburg* in character, directly following Chebyshev's tradition. This suggests he may have been influenced by both schools, or perhaps was a student or gymnasium teacher rather than a university professor.

## The European Continuation

### Robert Daublebsky von Sterneck (1898)

Two years after Aladov, the Austrian mathematician **Robert Daublebsky von Sterneck the Younger** (1871–1928) extended the work to patterns of length 3 and 4. Von Sterneck had received his doctorate from the University of Vienna in 1893 and was a Privatdozent there from 1896.

Remarkably, von Sterneck also published in *Matematicheskii Sbornik*:
- *"On the distribution of quadratic residues and non-residues of a prime number"* (Russian), *Mat. Sb.* **20** (1898), pp. 269–284

### Ernst Jacobsthal (1906)

The next major step came from **Ernst Erich Jacobsthal** (1882–1965), a German mathematician who completed his dissertation at the University of Berlin in 1906 under Ferdinand Georg Frobenius and Issai Schur.

The dissertation, titled *"Anwendung einer Formel aus der Theorie der quadratischen Reste"* (Application of a Formula from the Theory of Quadratic Residues), provided exact formulas for patterns of length 2 and 3.

Jacobsthal's later life was marked by tragedy: in 1934, he was dismissed from his professorship at the Technische Hochschule Berlin due to his Jewish origins. He fled to Norway in 1939 and after the war became a professor at the Norwegian Institute of Technology in Trondheim.

### Harold Davenport (1930s)

The English mathematician **Harold Davenport** (1907–1969) extended the theory to patterns of length 4 and beyond throughout the 1930s. His methods, while ingenious, became increasingly complex for longer patterns.

### André Weil (1948)

The definitive result came from **André Weil** in 1948, as a consequence of his proof of the Riemann hypothesis for curves over finite fields. Weil's bound showed that for any pattern length r:

*The count deviates from p/2^r by at most O(√p)*

This uniform bound, valid for all r, superseded all previous ad hoc methods.

## Connection to Our Work

### The mod 4 Structure

Aladov discovered that the count of consecutive quadratic residue patterns has an exact dependence on *p* mod 4. For length-2 patterns:

| p mod 4 | N_p(+,+) | N_p(+,−) | N_p(−,+) | N_p(−,−) |
|---------|----------|----------|----------|----------|
| 1 | (p−5)/4 | (p−1)/4 | (p−1)/4 | (p−1)/4 |
| 3 | (p−3)/4 | (p+1)/4 | (p−3)/4 | (p−3)/4 |

Our sign asymmetry formula A(p) also exhibits mod 4 dependence:
- p ≡ 1 (mod 4): A(p) = ±2
- p ≡ 3 (mod 4): A(p) = 0

Both phenomena arise from the same underlying fact: **−1 is a quadratic residue modulo p if and only if p ≡ 1 (mod 4)**.

### The Chebyshev–Beta Connection

Chebyshev's work extended beyond number theory. He also studied the beta function, examining integrals of the form ∫x^p(1−x)^q dx. This connects to our analysis of β_geom, which arises from Chebyshev polynomial lobe areas.

The fact that our modern exploration of Chebyshev polynomials leads back to quadratic residue patterns—a topic Chebyshev himself studied in 1849—suggests a deeper unity in his mathematical legacy that has not been fully explored.

## Open Questions

1. **Who was N. S. Aladov?** His identity remains unknown. Was he a student of Chebyshev? A gymnasium teacher? Did he publish other works under a different name?

2. **Why did von Sterneck publish in a Russian journal?** The Austrian mathematician's choice to publish in *Mat. Sb.* suggests active communication between Vienna and Moscow mathematical circles in the 1890s.

3. **Is there a direct connection between Chebyshev's beta function work and quadratic residue patterns?** The appearance of both topics in Chebyshev's legacy, and their reappearance in our β-function analysis, may not be coincidental.

## A Note on Historical Preservation and Expository Work

This document exists largely because **Keith Conrad** (University of Connecticut) took the time to trace the historical origins of quadratic residue pattern counting back to Aladov's 1896 paper. Without his *expository work*—writing that explains and contextualizes existing mathematics rather than presenting new results—Aladov would likely remain completely unknown to modern mathematicians.

Expository work is often undervalued in academia: it does not produce "new theorems," attracts fewer citations, and is rarely funded by grants. Yet it is **essential for the transmission of mathematical knowledge across generations**. Conrad's [collection of expository notes](https://kconrad.math.uconn.edu/blurbs/) represents hundreds of hours of careful reading, historical research, and clear writing—all made freely available online.

In the case of Aladov:
- The **original mathematics** belongs to Aladov (1896)
- The **rediscovery and contextualization** belongs to Conrad (2020s)
- Without the second, the first would be effectively invisible

**Note on Russian mathematical tradition:** Russian mathematicians have maintained awareness of Aladov independently. For example, Kiritchenko, Tsfasman, and Vladuts cite Aladov's work in recent papers on quadratic residue patterns (arXiv:2403.16326, 2024). However, this knowledge remained largely within the Russian-speaking mathematical community and did not cross into anglophone number theory literature until Conrad's expository work.

The situation illustrates a broader concern: **much of the mathematical heritage from the 19th and early 20th centuries exists only in physical archives or poorly digitized journals**. Information that is not actively "brought out" by researchers like Conrad risks being effectively lost to the online world—even when it technically exists somewhere.

The Russian mathematical portal [Math-Net.Ru](https://www.mathnet.ru/) deserves recognition for digitizing the *Matematicheskii Sbornik* archives back to 1866, making papers like Aladov's accessible. Similar digitization efforts for other historical journals would be invaluable.

**For future researchers:** If you encounter this document and have any information about N. S. Aladov's identity or other works, please consider documenting it.
