## The Exact Citation (from Keith Conrad)

From Conrad's expository notes [*Quadratic Residue Patterns Modulo a Prime*](https://kconrad.math.uconn.edu/blurbs/ugradnumthy/QuadraticResiduePatterns.pdf):

> **[1]** N. S. Aladov, "Sur la distribution des résidus quadratiques et non-quadratiques d'un nombre premier P dans la suite 1, 2, . . . , P − 1," (Russian) *Mat. Sb.* **18** (1896), 61–75.
> URL: http://mi.mathnet.ru/eng/msb/v18/i1/p61

Conrad's description of the work:

> "The first study of consecutive quadratic residue patterns modulo p was by Aladov [1] in 1896. He counted each quadratic residue pattern of length 2, and some (but not all) quadratic residue patterns of length 3."

## The Aladov Family (St. Petersburg)

From genealogical sources ([Geni.com](https://www.geni.com/people/%D0%98%D0%BB%D1%8C%D1%8F-%D0%90%D0%BB%D0%B0%D0%B4%D0%BE%D0%B2/6000000031451411072), [dic.academic.ru](https://dic.academic.ru/dic.nsf/bse/156387/Аладов)):

| Person | Dates | Initials | Notes |
|--------|-------|----------|-------|
| Semyon Nikolaevich Aladov | 1814–1880 | S. N. | Grandfather, Actual State Councillor |
| **Nikolai [Semyonovich?] Aladov** | 1849–**1871?** | **N. S.** | Died at 22? |
| Ilya Semyonovich Aladov | 1852–1916 | I. S. | Mathematician, member of St. Petersburg Mathematical Society |
| Nikolai Ilyich Aladov | 1890–1972 | N. I. | Composer (son of Ilya) |

### The Paradox

- **N. S. Aladov** submitted a paper on **February 20, 1894**
- **Nikolai Semyonovich Aladov** allegedly died on **February 19, 1871** — 23 years earlier!

If the genealogical data is correct, a dead man submitted a mathematics paper.

## Which Date Is Most Likely Wrong?

### Analysis of Source Reliability

| Date | Source Type | Error Probability |
|------|-------------|-------------------|
| Paper received 1894 | **Official journal archive** | LOW |
| Published 1896 | **Official journal archive** | LOW |
| Death 1871 | **User-contributed genealogy** (Geni.com) | **HIGH** |

### Reasoning

1. **Journal archives** (Math-Net.Ru) are digitized from physical publications. The dates 1894 (received) and 1896 (published) would have been printed in the original journal. Systematic errors in such data are rare.

2. **Genealogical databases** like Geni.com are user-contributed. Dates are often:
   - Transcribed from handwritten records (misread digits)
   - Copied from secondary sources with existing errors
   - Sometimes confused between family members

3. **The specific date "19.02.1871"** for Nikolai's death is suspiciously precise for a person with no known public record. Such precision often indicates a transcription from a document — but that document could itself contain errors.

### Most Likely Scenario

**The death date 1871 is probably wrong.**

Possibilities:
- **1891** instead of 1871 (digit transposition: 7↔9)
- **1897** or later (Nikolai lived longer than recorded)
- The date refers to a different event (emigration? leaving family records?)

If Nikolai was born in 1849 and submitted the paper in 1894, he would have been **45 years old** — a perfectly reasonable age for a mathematician publishing in a prestigious journal.

## Alternative Hypotheses

### Hypothesis A: Different Person Entirely

N. S. Aladov may be unrelated to the St. Petersburg Aladov family. "Aladov" is not an extremely rare surname — there could be another mathematician with the same initials.

**Problem:** We found no trace of any other N. S. Aladov in mathematical records.

### Hypothesis B: Ilya Published Under Brother's Name

Ilya Semyonovich Aladov (I. S.) was definitely a mathematician. Could he have published under his deceased brother's name?

**Actually plausible:** In 19th-century Russia, publishing under a deceased sibling's name as a tribute would not be unusual. If Nikolai had mathematical interests before his early death, Ilya might have wanted to honor his memory by attaching his name to a significant result.

### Hypothesis C: Pseudonym

N. S. Aladov could be a pseudonym for another mathematician.

**Problem:** Pseudonyms were rare in 19th-century mathematical publications. No supporting evidence.

## What Would Resolve This?

1. **Physical archives:**
   - Moscow Mathematical Society membership records (1890s)
   - St. Petersburg University alumni records
   - Russian Imperial civil service records (if N. S. held a position)

2. **Church records:**
   - Birth/baptism records for Nikolai Semyonovich Aladov
   - Death/burial records (to verify or refute the 1871 date)

3. **The paper itself:**
   - Does the original 1896 publication contain any biographical note about the author?
   - Are there acknowledgments or affiliations listed?

## Connection to Our Work

N. S. Aladov's 1896 paper established the **mod 4 structure** of consecutive quadratic residue patterns:

| p mod 4 | N_p(+,+) | N_p(+,−) | N_p(−,+) | N_p(−,−) |
|---------|----------|----------|----------|----------|
| 1 | (p−5)/4 | (p−1)/4 | (p−1)/4 | (p−1)/4 |
| 3 | (p−3)/4 | (p+1)/4 | (p−3)/4 | (p−3)/4 |

This is the same mod 4 dichotomy that appears in our sign asymmetry formula A(p).

The historical irony: we are building on work by a mathematician whose very existence is uncertain.

## Open Questions

1. **Who was N. S. Aladov?** Full name, dates, profession, affiliation?

2. **Is the 1871 death date correct?** If so, who actually wrote the 1896 paper?

3. **Are there other publications by N. S. Aladov?** The single paper suggests either:
   - A one-time contributor (teacher, amateur mathematician)
   - Other works under different name/initials
   - Lost or undigitized publications

4. **Why did von Sterneck (Vienna, 1898) also publish in Mat. Sb.?** Was there an international network around this topic that might illuminate Aladov's connections?
