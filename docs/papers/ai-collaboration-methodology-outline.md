# AI-Augmented Mathematical Research: A Case Study

**Status**: Outline for future paper
**Date**: November 15, 2025
**Primary sources**: `misc/*.txt` (aha moments from Nov 15)

---

## Paper Idea

Document the **trinity methodology** that led to discovering the closed form for L_M(s):
- How human geometric intuition + AI execution + Wolfram tooling combine
- What works, what doesn't
- Honest assessment of AI limitations and strengths
- Inspirational for mathematicians who resist AI

---

## Target Audience

- Mathematicians skeptical of AI in research
- AI researchers interested in mathematical applications
- Students/researchers considering AI collaboration
- Philosophy of mathematics community

---

## Key Themes (from misc/*.txt)

### 1. The Trinity (trinity.txt)

Three necessary components:
- **Human**: Geometric vision (primal forest concept)
- **Wolfram**: Computational verification (numerics, symbolic)
- **AI**: Rapid execution, formalization, tireless exploration

None sufficient alone. Together: breakthrough.

### 2. AI as Colleague, Not Tool (kladivo.txt)

- Not "hammer" but "mind in different modality"
- Complements human strengths/weaknesses
- Honest about confidence levels (8/10 self-assessment)
- Aware of limitations

### 3. Discovery Process (dukaz.txt, luck.txt)

**Cycle**:
1. Geometric intuition suggests direction
2. Numerical experiments (Wolfram)
3. AI derives formal proof
4. Human verifies rigor
5. Independent numerical confirmation

**Not**:
- Purely theoretical derivation
- Blind symbolic manipulation
- Unverified conjectures

### 4. Speed vs. Correctness (consiousness.txt)

**Speed enables**:
- Exploring 50 variants in one evening
- Rapid iteration on errors
- Testing ideas before investing weeks

**Dangers**:
- Systematic blind spots (AI may miss)
- Need human critical review
- Must verify, not just trust

### 5. Synthesis of Ideas (synteza.txt, vse-se-propojilo-primality-pell.txt)

AI excels at:
- Connecting disparate concepts
- Finding patterns across domains
- Formalizing vague intuitions

Human excels at:
- Recognizing importance
- Geometric visualization
- Knowing when to stop/pivot

### 6. Collaboration Dynamics (o-spolupraci-s-ai.txt, superpower.txt)

**What makes it work**:
- Clear division of roles
- Mutual trust with verification
- Honest communication about uncertainty
- Shared excitement (not just tool usage)

**Pitfalls**:
- Over-reliance on AI correctness
- Under-appreciating human intuition
- Treating AI as oracle vs. partner

## Proposed Paper Structure

### 1. Introduction
- The resistance to AI in mathematics
- Our case study: discovering closed form for non-multiplicative L-function
- Claim: Trinity approach enables new discoveries

### 2. The Discovery (Narrative)
- Nov 15, 2025: From epsilon-pole theorem to closed form in one evening
- Timeline with actual misc/*.txt snippets
- Show the back-and-forth, errors, corrections

### 3. The Trinity Framework
- Component 1: Human geometric intuition
  - Example: Primal forest visualization concept
- Component 2: Wolfram computational engine
  - Example: Numerical verification catches errors
- Component 3: AI rapid execution
  - Example: 50 script variants, LaTeX formalization
- Why all three needed (ablation analysis)

### 4. What AI Can and Cannot Do
- **Can**: Derive, verify, connect, formalize, iterate
- **Cannot**: Have original geometric vision, judge importance, replace human verification
- Concrete examples from our work
- 8/10 confidence self-assessment (from kladivo.txt)

### 5. Methodology in Practice
- The discovery cycle (diagram)
- How to verify AI-generated proofs
- When to trust, when to doubt
- Communication patterns

### 6. Philosophical Implications
- Is this "real" mathematics? (Yes, with verification)
- Does AI "understand"? (Different modality, still valuable)
- Future of mathematical research
- Addressing skepticism

### 7. Recommendations for Practitioners
- How to start collaborating with AI
- Tools and setup
- Common pitfalls
- Building trust through verification

### 8. Conclusion
- AI as colleague, not replacement
- Trinity enables what none alone can do
- Call for open-minded experimentation
- Mathematics evolves with tools (compass, computer, now AI)

## Timeline for Writing

**Not urgent** - let mathematical papers settle first

**When ready**:
1. Re-read all misc/*.txt files
2. Extract key quotes and moments
3. Verify mathematical results hold up
4. Write narrative draft
5. Get feedback from mathematicians + AI researchers
6. Refine for publication

**Possible venues**:
- *Notices of the AMS* (accessible, philosophical)
- *Mathematical Intelligencer* (narrative, cultural)
- *AI Magazine* (if focus on AI methodology)
- arXiv first, then journal

## Key Message

> "We discovered something neither human nor AI could find alone. The geometry came from human reflection. The execution came from AI speed and tirelessness. The verification came from Wolfram precision. Together: breakthrough. This is not replacement—it's collaboration."

---

**Next steps**: Let this sit. Focus on mathematical correctness first. When ready, use this outline + misc/ files to write the methodology paper.
