# The 290-Theorem

**Status:** Proved (Bhargava-Hanke, ~2005)
**Field:** Arithmetic of quadratic forms

---

## Statement

### Theorem 1 (The 290-Theorem)

A positive-definite quadratic form with integer coefficients represents **all positive integers** if and only if it represents these 29 critical integers:

```
1, 2, 3, 5, 6, 7, 10, 13, 14, 15, 17, 19, 21, 22, 23, 26,
29, 30, 31, 34, 35, 37, 42, 58, 93, 110, 145, 203, 290
```

### Theorem 2 (Minimality)

For **each** critical integer t, there exists a positive-definite quadratic form which:
- Fails to represent t
- Represents every other positive integer

### Theorem 3 (The Role of 290)

If a positive-definite quadratic form represents every positive integer below 290, then it represents every integer above 290.

### Theorem 4 (Enumeration)

There are exactly **6436** universal quaternary (4-variable) quadratic forms.

## Background

### Universal Quadratic Forms

A quadratic form Q(x₁, ..., xₙ) = Σ aᵢⱼxᵢxⱼ is **universal** if for every positive integer n, there exist integers x₁, ..., xₙ such that Q = n.

**Lagrange's Four Squares Theorem (1770):** Every positive integer is a sum of four squares.
```
n = x² + y² + z² + w²
```
This proves x² + y² + z² + w² is universal.

### The 15-Theorem (Conway-Schneeberger, 1993)

A positive-definite quadratic form with **integer matrix** is universal if and only if it represents:
```
1, 2, 3, 5, 6, 7, 10, 14, 15
```

Bhargava simplified the proof in 2000.

### From 15 to 290

The 15-theorem applies to forms with integer matrix (coefficients in ℤ).
The 290-theorem applies to forms with integer coefficients (coefficients in ½ℤ allowed in matrix).

## The Escalation Method

### Key Concepts

**Truant:** The smallest positive integer not represented by a form.

**Escalation:** Given a non-universal lattice L with truant t, an escalation is a lattice generated by L and a vector of norm t.

**Escalator lattice:** A lattice obtained by successive escalations starting from the zero lattice.

### The Algorithm

1. Start with zero lattice (truant = 1)
2. Escalate by adding vector of norm = truant
3. Find all non-isometric escalator lattices
4. Critical integers = union of all truants that appear

### Dimension Progression

| Dimension | Number of escalators | Truants appearing |
|-----------|---------------------|-------------------|
| 0 | 1 | 1 |
| 1 | 1 | 2 |
| 2 | 3 | 3, 5 |
| 3 | 34 | 5, 6, 7, 10, 13, 14, 17, 21, 22, 23, 29, 31 |
| 4 | 6560 | 10, 13, 14, 15, 19, 21, 23, 26, 30, 34, 35, 37, 42, 58, 93, 110, 145 |
| 5 | ~millions | 203, 290 |
| 6+ | universal | — |

**No escalator exceeds dimension 7.**

## Properties of Critical Integers

### All are squarefree

If a form represents n, it represents n·k² for any k (by scaling the solution vector).
Therefore, a truant must be squarefree.

**Verification:** All 29 critical integers are squarefree.

### None are divisible by 4

If a form represents n, it represents 4n (by doubling all variables).
Therefore, a truant cannot be ≡ 0 (mod 4).

**Verification:** No critical integer is divisible by 4.

### Distribution

| Property | Count |
|----------|-------|
| Primes | 11 (2, 3, 5, 7, 13, 17, 19, 23, 29, 31, 37) |
| Squarefree | 29 (all) |
| ≡ 1 (mod 4) | 9 |
| ≡ 2 (mod 4) | 12 |
| ≡ 3 (mod 4) | 8 |
| Multiples of 29 | 5 (29, 58, 145, 203, 290) |

### Fibonacci numbers in critical set

{1, 2, 3, 5, 13, 21, 34} — seven Fibonacci numbers appear.

## Why 290 is Special

The escalator L₁₄₅ (with truant 145) fails to represent only three integers: **145, 203, 290**.

Any escalator with truant 290 must arise from L₁₄₅, and will represent all integers > 290.

This makes 290 the **unique cutoff** — the largest number that needs explicit checking.

## Significance

### For Number Theory

- Completes classification of universal quaternary forms (exactly 6436)
- Extends Ramanujan's work on diagonal forms (54 universal diagonal forms)
- Demonstrates power of geometric methods in arithmetic

### For "Small Numbers" Philosophy

The 290-Theorem is perhaps the cleanest example of small numbers determining infinite behavior:

| Input | Output |
|-------|--------|
| Check 29 integers (max 290) | Decide for ALL ∞ positive integers |

Compare with other "small determines large" results:

| Theorem | Small input | Determines |
|---------|------------|------------|
| **290-Theorem** | 29 integers ≤ 290 | Universal quadratic form |
| Miller-Rabin | 12 primes ≤ 37 | Primality for n < 2⁶⁴ |
| Fermat two-square | mod 4 | p = x² + y² solvability |
| Quadratic reciprocity | mod 4 residues | Legendre symbols |
