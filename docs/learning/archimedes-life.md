## Overview

Archimedes is considered one of the greatest mathematicians and scientists of classical antiquity. He made fundamental contributions to geometry, hydrostatics, mechanics, and anticipated integral calculus by nearly two millennia.

---

## Life

### Birth and Family

- **Born:** c. 287 BC in Syracuse, Sicily (then a Greek colony in Magna Graecia)
- **Died:** c. 212 BC during the Roman siege of Syracuse
- **Father:** Phidias, an astronomer (mentioned in *The Sand-Reckoner*)
- **Connection to royalty:** Plutarch claims Archimedes was "a friend and near relation" of King Hiero II of Syracuse; however, Cicero and Silius Italicus suggest humble origins

**Source for birth date:** The Byzantine scholar John Tzetzes (12th century) states Archimedes lived 75 years. Working backwards from his death in 212 BC gives c. 287 BC.

### Education

Little is known with certainty. It is believed he may have studied in Alexandria, given his correspondence with scholars there (especially Eratosthenes, Conon of Samos, and Dositheus of Pelusium).

### Relationship with King Hiero II

Archimedes dedicated *The Sand-Reckoner* to Gelon, son of King Hiero II, indicating a close relationship with the royal family. According to various sources, he:
- Designed war machines for the defense of Syracuse
- Investigated the suspected fraud of the golden crown (see below)
- Demonstrated mechanical principles to the king

| *The Sand-Reckoner* | System for expressing extremely large numbers |
| *On Spirals* | Properties of the Archimedean spiral |

## Inventions and Engineering

### The Lever

**Famous quote:** "Give me a place to stand, and I will move the world" (Greek: δῶς μοι πᾶ στῶ καὶ τὰν γᾶν κινάσω)

Archimedes did not invent the lever, but he provided the first rigorous mathematical explanation of the principle in *On the Equilibrium of Planes*.

**Demonstration for Hiero:** According to Plutarch, Archimedes demonstrated the principle by single-handedly moving a fully loaded ship using a compound pulley system.

### Archimedes' Screw

A device for lifting water, consisting of a helical screw inside a cylinder. When rotated, it raises water from a lower to higher level.

**Uses:**
- Irrigation
- Bilge pumping on ships
- Still used today in some water treatment plants

**Note:** Some scholars argue the device predates Archimedes and he merely improved or popularized it.

### War Machines (Siege of Syracuse, 214-212 BC)

During the Second Punic War, Syracuse allied with Carthage against Rome. Archimedes personally oversaw the deployment of defensive machines:

1. **Improved catapults** - Variable range weapons that could strike ships at different distances
2. **The Claw of Archimedes** (also "ship shaker") - Crane with grappling hook that lifted enemy ships and dropped them
3. **Cranes dropping heavy stones/lead** on Roman ships

**Sources:** Plutarch, Livy, and Polybius all describe these machines.

**Modern verification:** A 2005 documentary (*Superweapons of the Ancient World*) built a working replica of the Claw and confirmed its feasibility.

### Burning Mirrors (Disputed)

The story that Archimedes used mirrors to focus sunlight and set Roman ships on fire is **not mentioned** by Plutarch, Livy, or Polybius. It first appears in later sources (Lucian, 2nd century AD; Anthemius of Tralles, 6th century).

Modern experiments (including *MythBusters*) have generally concluded this would be impractical under real combat conditions.

### Other Attributed Inventions

- **Odometer** - Mechanism to measure distance traveled (attributed but uncertain)
- **Planetarium** - Mechanical model of the heavens (mentioned by Cicero)

## Famous Stories

### The Golden Crown and "Eureka!"

**Source:** Vitruvius, *De Architectura* (1st century BC) - written ~150 years after Archimedes' death.

**The story:**
1. King Hiero II commissioned a golden crown (or wreath) for a temple
2. He suspected the goldsmith had mixed in cheaper silver
3. He asked Archimedes to determine if fraud occurred without damaging the crown
4. While entering a bath, Archimedes noticed the water level rise
5. He realized he could measure volume by water displacement
6. He allegedly ran naked through the streets crying "Eureka!" (εὕρηκα = "I have found it!")

**Scientific critique:**
- The method (comparing water displaced by crown vs. equal mass of pure gold) would require extremely precise measurements
- The difference in volume would be very small and hard to detect
- Galileo (1586) proposed an alternative: Archimedes may have used a hydrostatic balance instead

**Historical note:** The story may be apocryphal or embellished, but the principle of buoyancy (Archimedes' principle) is rigorously proven in *On Floating Bodies*.

### Defense of Syracuse

For two years (214-212 BC), Archimedes' machines held off the Roman siege under General Marcus Claudius Marcellus.

According to Plutarch: The Romans "began to believe they were fighting against a supernatural foe" and "retreated whenever they saw a rope or stick projecting over the walls."

## Death

### The Siege

In 212 BC, during a festival, Roman forces breached Syracuse's defenses. General Marcellus had ordered that Archimedes be captured alive.

### Accounts of His Death

Multiple versions exist:

1. **Livy's account** (oldest): Archimedes was drawing geometric figures in the sand/dust when a Roman soldier killed him, not knowing who he was.

2. **Plutarch's account:** A soldier demanded Archimedes accompany him. Archimedes refused, saying he needed to finish his problem. The soldier killed him.

3. **Plutarch's alternative:** Archimedes was carrying mathematical instruments when a soldier killed him thinking they were valuable.

### "Do Not Disturb My Circles"

The famous last words "Noli turbare circulos meos" (Latin) / "μὴ μου τοὺς κύκλους τάραττε" (Greek) do **not** appear in Plutarch's account.

A similar phrase appears in **Valerius Maximus** (c. 30 AD): "I beg of you, do not disturb this" (referring to his diagram in the sand).

The phrase became famous through later tradition but should be considered legendary rather than historical.

### Marcellus's Reaction

Plutarch: "It is generally agreed that Marcellus was afflicted at his death, and turned away from his slayer as from a polluted person, and sought out the kindred of Archimedes and paid them honour."

### Tomb

According to Cicero (who claims to have found and restored it in 75 BC), Archimedes' tomb bore a sculpture of a **sphere inscribed in a cylinder** - representing his proudest discovery that the sphere has 2/3 the volume and surface area of its circumscribing cylinder.

## Legacy

- **Anticipation of calculus:** His "method of exhaustion" and use of infinitesimals (revealed in the Palimpsest) prefigured integral calculus by ~1900 years
- **Foundations of hydrostatics:** Archimedes' principle remains fundamental to physics
- **Influence on later scientists:** Galileo, Newton, and Leibniz all studied his works
- **Modern honors:** Lunar crater "Archimedes," asteroid 3600 Archimedes, Fields Medal features his portrait
