## Major Contributions

### The 290-Theorem (with Manjul Bhargava, ~2005)

Hanke's most celebrated work is the proof of the 290-Theorem, jointly with Manjul Bhargava. Their collaboration combined:

- **Bhargava's** geometric and theoretical innovations (escalation method, lattice geometry)
- **Hanke's** computational expertise and systematic enumeration

> *"We were both interested in questions about quadratic forms, though from different perspectives."* — Jonathan Hanke

The collaboration took several years and required both theoretical breakthroughs and massive computation to enumerate all escalator lattices.

**Key results:**
1. A positive-definite integral quadratic form is universal iff it represents 29 critical integers (max 290)
2. There are exactly **6436** universal quaternary quadratic forms

### SAGE QuadraticForm Class

Hanke wrote the `QuadraticForm` class for the [SAGE](https://www.sagemath.org/) open-source computer algebra system, making quadratic form computations accessible to researchers worldwide.

### Mass Formulas

His dissertation work on exact mass formulas for quadratic forms over number fields provides tools for counting lattices with prescribed local properties.

## On Being Shimura's Student

Goro Shimura (1930–2019) was one of the giants of 20th-century mathematics, known for the Shimura variety, Shimura correspondence, and the Taniyama-Shimura conjecture (key to Fermat's Last Theorem proof).

Hanke was Shimura's **last graduate student**, a fact he treasures:

> *"It is the highest privilege of my academic life to have been his student and to grow under the tutelage of a master like Goro Shimura... I have never met his equal and deeply treasure the time we have spent together — as adviser, then colleague and later as a friend."*

## Recognition

The 290-Theorem is referenced in Bhargava's 2014 Fields Medal citation. Hanke continues to be recognized for his contributions to computational number theory and his work making quadratic form tools accessible through SAGE.
