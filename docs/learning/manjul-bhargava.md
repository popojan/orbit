## Biography

Manjul Bhargava was born in Hamilton, Ontario, Canada, to Indian immigrant parents. His mother, Mira Bhargava, is a mathematician and professor at Hofstra University. His maternal grandfather, Purushottam Lal Bhargava, was head of the Sanskrit department at the University of Rajasthan in Jaipur.

Bhargava grew up primarily on Long Island, New York, completing all high school mathematics and computer science courses by age 14 at Plainedge High School in North Massapequa (graduated 1992).

### Education

- **B.A.** Harvard University, 1996 (awarded Morgan Prize for undergraduate research)
- **Ph.D.** Princeton University, 2001, supervised by **Andrew Wiles**

## Major Contributions

### The 15 Theorem (simplified proof, 2000)

The original **Conway-Schneeberger Fifteen Theorem** (1993) states:

> A positive-definite quadratic form with integer matrix is universal (represents all positive integers) if and only if it represents the integers 1, 2, 3, 5, 6, 7, 10, 14, 15.

Conway and Schneeberger's proof was complicated and never published. Bhargava found a much simpler geometric proof, published in 2000.

### The 290 Theorem (with Jonathan Hanke, ~2005)

Announced at the 2005 SASTRA Ramanujan Prize ceremony:

> A positive-definite **integral** quadratic form is universal if and only if it represents these 29 critical integers:
>
> 1, 2, 3, 5, 6, 7, 10, 13, 14, 15, 17, 19, 21, 22, 23, 26, 29, 30, 31, 34, 35, 37, 42, 58, 93, 110, 145, 203, **290**

This set is minimal - removing any single number makes the theorem false.

**Corollary:** There are exactly **6436** universal quaternary (4-variable) quadratic forms.

### Composition Laws on Higher-Degree Forms

Bhargava generalized Gauss's composition law on binary quadratic forms to higher-degree forms, discovering new composition laws that had been missed for 200 years. This work was inspired by:
1. Brahmagupta's 7th-century identity on sums of squares
2. A Rubik's cube visualization

### Elliptic Curves

Bounded the average rank of elliptic curves, with applications to the Birch and Swinnerton-Dyer conjecture.

## Sanskrit Mathematics Connection

Bhargava learned Sanskrit from his grandfather during childhood visits to Jaipur. He read ancient Indian mathematical texts in the original, including works by **Brahmagupta** (628 CE).

### Brahmagupta's Inspiration

Brahmagupta's identity states that the product of two sums of two squares is again a sum of two squares:

```
(a² + b²)(c² + d²) = (ac - bd)² + (ad + bc)²
```

Bhargava: *"When I saw this math in my grandfather's manuscript, I got very excited."*

This led him to seek simpler proofs of Gauss's composition law. Where Gauss needed 20 pages, Bhargava (using geometric insights from Brahmagupta and the Rubik's cube) achieved it in a few lines.

### Philosophy of Original Sources

> *"By going back to the original you can bypass the way of thinking that history has somehow decided to take, and by forgetting about that you can then take your own path. Sometimes you get too influenced by the way people have thought about something for two hundred years."*

## Other Interests

Bhargava is an accomplished **tabla player**, having studied since age 3 with masters including Ustad Zakir Hussain. He sees connections between the rhythmic patterns of Indian classical music and mathematical structures.

## Relevance to Orbit Project

The 290 Theorem is a perfect example of the "small numbers conjecture" - that finite sets of small numbers determine properties of ALL numbers:

| Property | Small number bound | Determines |
|----------|-------------------|------------|
| Universal quadratic form (integer matrix) | 15 | All positive integers |
| Universal quadratic form (integral) | 290 | All positive integers |
| Primality (Miller-Rabin) | 12 small primes | Any 64-bit number |
| Two-square representability | 4 (mod) | Any prime |

Bhargava's work shows this isn't just intuition - it's **provable structure**.
