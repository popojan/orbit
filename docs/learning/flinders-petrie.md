## The Giza Survey (1880-1883)

### Motivation

Petrie's father William was interested in Charles Piazzi Smyth's theory that Biblical prophecy was encoded in the Great Pyramid's measurements. They traveled to Egypt to obtain precise measurements to verify this theory.

### Outcome

Petrie's meticulous measurements **disproved** Smyth's theory. The "pyramid inch" was shown to be a logical fallacy.

### Publication

**"The Pyramids and Temples of Gizeh" (1883)** — remained the standard reference until 1925.

## Key Measurements

### The Royal Cubit

Petrie determined the Egyptian royal cubit from multiple sources:

| Source | Cubit length |
|--------|--------------|
| King's Chamber dimensions | 20.620 ± 0.005 inches |
| Isaac Newton's estimate | 20.63 inches |
| Extant cubit sticks | 523-539 mm (20.6-21.2 inches) |

**Adopted value:** 20.62 inches = 52.4 cm

### Great Pyramid Base

- Measured: **9068.8 inches**
- In cubits: 9068.8 / 20.62 = **439.8 ≈ 440 cubits**
- Error: 0.05%

### Methodology Note

The cubit length was derived assuming Egyptians designed in whole cubits. This introduces potential circularity:

1. Assume round cubit dimensions
2. Measure in inches
3. Calculate cubit to make it round
4. Apply to other structures

**However:** The consistency across multiple independent structures (King's Chamber, passages, base) and agreement with surviving cubit sticks validates the 20.62" estimate.

## Scientific Contributions

1. **Sequence dating** — dating layers by pottery styles (stratigraphy)
2. **Systematic excavation** — careful recording of find locations
3. **Rejection of pseudoscience** — disproved "pyramid inch" numerology despite personal motivation to confirm it

## The Smyth Affair

**Charles Piazzi Smyth** (Astronomer Royal for Scotland) claimed:
- The pyramid encoded π, the Earth's dimensions, Biblical chronology
- A special "pyramid inch" = 1/25 of a cubit was divinely inspired

**Petrie's response:**
> "There is no authentic example, that will bear examination, of the use or existence of any such measure as a 'Pyramid inch.'"

This established Petrie's reputation for rigorous, evidence-based archaeology.
