## Overview

Eratosthenes was a Greek polymath: mathematician, geographer, poet, astronomer, and music theorist. He is best known for:
1. First accurate measurement of Earth's circumference
2. Invention of the Sieve of Eratosthenes for finding prime numbers
3. Serving as chief librarian of the Library of Alexandria
4. Coining the term "geography" and founding scientific cartography

## Life

### Birth and Origin

- **Born:** c. 276 BC in Cyrene (modern Libya)
- **Died:** c. 194 BC in Alexandria, Egypt
- **Father:** Aglaos (or Aglaus)

**Cyrene:** Founded by Greeks in the 7th century BC, Cyrene was a major intellectual center. Its location near the sea, good water sources, and fertile soil made it prosperous.

### Nicknames

Eratosthenes had two contrasting nicknames reflecting different assessments of his abilities:

| Nickname | Meaning | Source |
|----------|---------|--------|
| **Beta** (Β) | "Second" or "Number Two" | Suda (10th c. encyclopedia) |
| **Pentathlos** | "All-around athlete" (like Olympic pentathlon) | Admirers |
| **"Second Plato"** | Comparison to Plato | Some contemporaries |

The nickname "Beta" implied he was second-best in every field but first in none. His admirers saw this breadth as a virtue (Pentathlos), while critics saw it as a lack of focus.

### Education

According to the Suda and Loeb Classical Library, Eratosthenes studied under:

1. **Lysanias of Cyrene** - Grammarian and philologist specializing in Homer
2. **Ariston of Chios** - Stoic philosopher, student of Zeno of Citium
3. **Callimachus** - Poet and scholar (also from Cyrene), though possibly not a formal teacher

Eratosthenes later wrote a biographical sketch of Ariston.

### Career in Alexandria

**c. 245 BC:** Ptolemy III Euergetes invited Eratosthenes to Alexandria to tutor his son (the future Ptolemy IV Philopator).

**c. 236 BC:** Appointed chief librarian (διοικητής) of the Library of Alexandria, succeeding Zenodotus. This was the most prestigious academic position in the ancient world.

The Library of Alexandria is said to have contained over 400,000-700,000 scrolls (estimates vary).

Eratosthenes remained in Alexandria for the rest of his life.

### Death

Eratosthenes went blind in his old age. According to ancient sources, he chose to end his life by **voluntary starvation** (perhaps seeing blindness as incompatible with scholarship).

## Major Achievements

### 1. Measurement of Earth's Circumference (c. 240 BC)

**The Method:**

Eratosthenes used the difference in the Sun's angle at two locations on the same meridian:

1. **Syene** (modern Aswan): At noon on summer solstice, the Sun was directly overhead (no shadow; sunlight reached the bottom of a deep well)
2. **Alexandria:** At the same moment, a vertical gnomon (stick) cast a shadow

**Observations:**
- Shadow angle in Alexandria: ~7.2° (= 1/50 of a full circle)
- Distance Syene to Alexandria: ~5,000 stadia (measured by professional bematists - surveyors who counted paces)

**Calculation:**
- If 7.2° = 5,000 stadia
- Then 360° = 250,000 stadia (or 252,000 according to Strabo)

**Assumptions (approximately correct):**
1. Sun is far enough that rays are parallel
2. Alexandria is due north of Syene (close but not exact)
3. Syene is on the Tropic of Cancer (close but not exact)

**Accuracy:**

The accuracy depends on which "stadion" Eratosthenes used (the unit varied by region):

| Stadion length | Calculated circumference | Error |
|----------------|-------------------------|-------|
| ~157.5 m (Egyptian) | ~39,690 km | ~0.5% too small |
| ~185 m (Attic) | ~46,620 km | ~16% too large |

Modern value: ~40,075 km (equatorial)

If Eratosthenes used the Egyptian stadion, his measurement was **remarkably accurate** (within 1-2%).

**Sources:** Cleomedes (*On the Circular Motions of the Celestial Bodies*) and Strabo (*Geography*)

### 2. Sieve of Eratosthenes

An algorithm for finding all prime numbers up to a given limit:

**Method:**
1. Write all integers from 2 to n
2. Start with 2 (first prime)
3. Cross out all multiples of 2
4. Find next uncrossed number (3), cross out its multiples
5. Repeat until √n is reached
6. Remaining uncrossed numbers are primes

**Note:** According to Hans-Joachim Waschkies, Eratosthenes may not have invented this method but rather **named** it ("sieve" = κόσκινον).

The algorithm remains important in number theory and computer science (with modern optimizations).

### 3. Geography (Γεωγραφικά)

A three-volume work that **coined the term "geography"** (γεωγραφία = "earth-writing").

**Contents:**
- First systematic attempt to map the known world
- Over 400 cities with locations
- First use of parallels and meridians for positioning
- Division of Earth into five climate zones:
  - Two frigid zones (polar)
  - Two temperate zones
  - One torrid zone (equatorial)

**Controversial aspect:** Challenged the Homeric worldview, which many considered sacred.

**Status:** Lost, but extensively quoted by Strabo and others.

### 4. Chronology

Eratosthenes founded **scientific chronology** - the systematic dating of historical events using Egyptian and Persian records.

**Notable calculation:** Dated the fall of Troy to **1184 BC** (still cited today, though considered approximate).

### 5. Other Contributions

- **Armillary sphere:** Hipparchus credited Eratosthenes with inventing this astronomical instrument (spherical framework of rings modeling celestial motions)
- **Map of the Nile:** More accurate mapping than predecessors
- **Leap year calendar:** Developed a calendar accounting for the ~365.25 day year
- **Work "On Means":** Mathematical treatise (lost)
- **Poetry and drama criticism:** Wrote on theater and literature

## Connection to Archimedes

Eratosthenes corresponded with Archimedes. Two important connections:

1. **The Method:** Archimedes' treatise revealing his heuristic techniques was addressed to Eratosthenes.

2. **Cattle Problem:** The famous arithmetic problem (Problema Bovinum) was sent by Archimedes to "those in Alexandria" and specifically to Eratosthenes.

This correspondence shows the intellectual network connecting Syracuse and Alexandria in the 3rd century BC.

## Legacy

- **"Father of Geography"** - Founded scientific geography and cartography
- **Measurement method** - His technique for measuring Earth's circumference was used (with refinements) for centuries
- **Sieve algorithm** - Still fundamental in computer science
- **Lunar crater** - "Eratosthenes" crater on the Moon
- **Seamount** - Eratosthenes Seamount in the Mediterranean
