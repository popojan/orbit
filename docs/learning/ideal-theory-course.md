## Chapter 1: Motivation - Why Ideals?

### Context

In ordinary integers ℤ, we have **unique prime factorization**:
- Every n ∈ ℤ factors uniquely: n = p₁^a₁ · p₂^a₂ · ... · pₖ^aₖ
- Example: 12 = 2² · 3

This is so fundamental that we often take it for granted.

### The Problem

But when we extend to **algebraic integers** (like ℤ[√-5]), unique factorization can FAIL!

Example in ℤ[√-5]:
```
6 = 2 · 3
6 = (1 + √-5)(1 - √-5)
```

**Socratic Question 1:**
Are these genuinely different factorizations? Or could 2, 3 be "associates" of (1±√-5)?
*Hint: Check if ratios are units (elements with inverse).*

---

### The units check

In ℤ[√-5], the only units are ±1.

To see if 2 and (1+√-5) are associates, we'd need:
```
2 = u · (1+√-5)  where u ∈ {±1}
```

But 2/(1+√-5) = 2(1-√-5)/6 = (1-√-5)/3 ∉ ℤ[√-5]

So 2 and (1+√-5) are NOT associates.

**Socratic Question 2:**
Is 2 "prime" in ℤ[√-5]? What about in ℤ?
*Hint: Can you factor 2 into non-units?*

---

### Primes vs irreducibles

In ℤ[√-5]:
- 2 is **irreducible** (cannot factor into non-units)
- BUT 2 is not **prime** (does not satisfy: if 2|ab then 2|a or 2|b)

Check: 2 | 6 = (1+√-5)(1-√-5), but 2 ∤ (1+√-5) and 2 ∤ (1-√-5)

In ℤ, irreducible ⟺ prime. But in ℤ[√-5], they differ!

**Socratic Question 3:**
If elements can be irreducible without being prime, can we still do arithmetic?
Can we recover some notion of "unique factorization" at a different level?

---

### The Ideal Solution

**Kummer's insight (1840s):** Factor IDEALS instead of ELEMENTS.

Key idea:
- Elements may not factor uniquely
- But principal ideals (2), (3), (1+√-5), (1-√-5) DO factor uniquely into PRIME IDEALS

Example:
```
(6) = (2) · (3)  [principal ideals]
```

But (2) and (3) are not prime ideals! They factor further:
```
(2) = P₂²
(3) = P₃ · P₃'
```

where P₂, P₃, P₃' are prime ideals.

**Socratic Question 4:**
If (2) = P₂², what does P₂ look like explicitly?
*Hint: It's generated by 2 and something involving √-5.*

### Next Chapter Preview

We need to:
1. Define what "algebraic integer" means precisely in Q(√n)
2. Understand the ring of integers 𝓞_K
3. Define ideals formally and see how they multiply

**Before continuing:** Any questions about motivation? The core tension is:
- Elements lose unique factorization
- Ideals restore it

## Chapter 2: Algebraic Integers in Q(√n)

### Algebraic Numbers

**Definition:** α is **algebraic** over ℚ if it satisfies some polynomial with rational coefficients:
```
aₙαⁿ + aₙ₋₁αⁿ⁻¹ + ... + a₁α + a₀ = 0,  aᵢ ∈ ℚ, aₙ ≠ 0
```

Examples:
- √2 is algebraic: α² - 2 = 0
- (1+√5)/2 is algebraic: α² - α - 1 = 0
- π is NOT algebraic (transcendental)

**Socratic Question 5:**
Is every rational number algebraic?
*Hint: If r = p/q ∈ ℚ, find a polynomial it satisfies.*

---

### Algebraic Integers

**Definition:** α is an **algebraic integer** if it satisfies a MONIC polynomial with ℤ coefficients:
```
αⁿ + aₙ₋₁αⁿ⁻¹ + ... + a₁α + a₀ = 0,  aᵢ ∈ ℤ
```

Note: Leading coefficient must be 1 (monic).

Examples:
- √2 is algebraic integer: α² - 2 = 0 ✓
- 1/2 is NOT algebraic integer: satisfies 2α - 1 = 0, but not monic
- (1+√5)/2 IS algebraic integer: α² - α - 1 = 0 ✓

**Socratic Question 6:**
Which ordinary integers n ∈ ℤ are algebraic integers?
*Hint: What polynomial does n satisfy?*

---

### Ring of Integers in Q(√n)

For quadratic field K = ℚ(√n), n squarefree, the **ring of integers** 𝓞_K depends on n mod 4:

**Case 1: n ≡ 2, 3 (mod 4)**
```
𝓞_K = ℤ[√n] = {a + b√n : a,b ∈ ℤ}
```

Examples:
- ℚ(√2): 𝓞_K = ℤ[√2]
- ℚ(√-5): 𝓞_K = ℤ[√-5]

**Case 2: n ≡ 1 (mod 4)**
```
𝓞_K = ℤ[(1+√n)/2] = {a + b(1+√n)/2 : a,b ∈ ℤ}
```

Examples:
- ℚ(√5): 𝓞_K = ℤ[(1+√5)/2] (golden ratio φ!)
- ℚ(√-3): 𝓞_K = ℤ[(1+√-3)/2] (Eisenstein integers)

**Socratic Question 7:**
Why does (1+√5)/2 appear in Case 2 but not Case 1?
*Hint: Check if (1+√5)/2 satisfies a monic polynomial with ℤ coefficients.*

---

### Verification for n ≡ 1 (mod 4)

Let α = (1+√n)/2. Then:
```
2α = 1 + √n
4α² = 1 + 2√n + n
4α² = (n+1) + 2√n
4α² - 4α = (n+1) - 2 = n-1
α² - α = (n-1)/4
```

So α² - α - (n-1)/4 = 0.

When n ≡ 1 (mod 4), (n-1)/4 ∈ ℤ, so this is monic with ℤ coefficients!

**Socratic Question 8:**
What happens if n ≡ 3 (mod 4)? Is (1+√n)/2 still an algebraic integer?
*Hint: Check if (n-1)/4 ∈ ℤ.*

---

### Norm and Trace

For α = a + b√n ∈ ℚ(√n), define:

**Conjugate:**
```
α' = a - b√n
```

**Norm:**
```
N(α) = α · α' = a² - nb²
```

**Trace:**
```
Tr(α) = α + α' = 2a
```

**Socratic Question 9:**
For α = (1+√-5), compute N(α) and Tr(α).
Does the norm have any multiplicative property?

---

### Properties

**Norm is multiplicative:**
```
N(αβ) = N(α) · N(β)
```

Proof:
```
N(αβ) = (αβ)(αβ)' = (αβ)(α'β') = (αα')(ββ') = N(α)N(β)
```

**Application:** α is a unit ⟺ N(α) = ±1

Why? If αβ = 1, then N(α)N(β) = 1, so N(α) = ±1 (in ℤ).

**Socratic Question 10:**
Find all units in ℤ[√-5].
*Hint: Solve a² + 5b² = 1 in integers.*
