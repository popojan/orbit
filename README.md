# Orbit: Mathematical Explorations

[![DOI](https://zenodo.org/badge/DOI/10.5281/zenodo.17802020.svg)](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.17802020)

This repository contains computational explorations in number theory and related mathematics, implemented as a Wolfram Language paclet. The work is ongoing, unpublished, and has not been peer-reviewed.

## Featured: Rational Circle Algebra

**42 characters.** The golden 17-pointed star from Gauss's monument in Braunschweig:

```mathematica
Graphics@{Hue@π,Polygon@κ@ρ[17,7Range@17]}
```

This uses our **Rational Circle Algebra** where multiplication becomes addition:
- `t₁ ⊗ t₂ = t₁ + t₂ + 5/4` (stays rational!)
- `ρ[n,k] = 2k/n - 5/4` (n-th root of unity, always rational)
- `κ[t]` converts to coordinates only when needed

All circle operations stay in ℚ until the final `κ` bridge. See [CircFunctions.wl](Orbit/Kernel/CircFunctions.wl).

## Using the Code

All scripts require Wolfram Language (Mathematica or free Wolfram Engine):

```bash
# Load the paclet
wolframscript -code "<< Orbit\`"

# Or run individual scripts
wolframscript -file scripts/[script-name].wl
```

## Recent Results

**Latest work** (December 2025):
- ✅ **Rational Circle Algebra**: Circle multiplication as `t₁ + t₂ + 5/4` — stays in ℚ until coordinate conversion. Gauss 17-star in 42 chars!
- ✅ **Multiplicative Decomposition Theorem**: For composite n = md, lobe areas of n-gon Chebyshev polygon function satisfy Σ A(n, k≡r mod m) = 1/m (proven via roots of unity cancellation)
- Connection between Chebyshev composition Tₘ(Tₙ(x)) = Tₘₙ(x) and geometric lobe area structure
- Unified Chebyshev framework σ_m for square root iteration with arbitrary integer convergence order ≥ 3

### A Historical Note

During literature review, we traced the history of quadratic residue pattern counting back to **N. S. Aladov (1896)** — a mathematician virtually unknown in anglophone literature. This attribution comes from Keith Conrad's [expository notes](https://kconrad.math.uconn.edu/blurbs/ugradnumthy/QuadraticResiduePatterns.pdf); Russian mathematicians (Kiritchenko, Tsfasman, Vlăduț) have maintained awareness of Aladov independently.

Aladov's identity remains a minor historical mystery — see [our investigation](docs/sessions/2025-12-04-beta-functions-analysis/aladov-mystery.md).
