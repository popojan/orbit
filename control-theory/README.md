## Purpose

Secondary research thread exploring Control Theory applications using Wolfram Language. This serves dual purposes:

1. **Business case** - Demonstrate Wolfram's value for practical engineering (control systems design)
2. **Token utilization** - Productive use of available computational resources

**Note**: This is separate from the main Number Theory research (`/docs`, `/scripts`). Kept isolated to avoid cross-contamination of topics.

## Scope

Exploring classical and modern control theory:
- PID controller design and stability analysis
- System identification from data
- Symbolic analysis (Routh-Hurwitz, Root Locus, Nyquist)
- Transfer function manipulation
- State-space representation

## Why Wolfram for Control Theory?

**Traditional tool**: MATLAB Control System Toolbox (expensive, numeric-focused)

**Wolfram advantages**:
- **Symbolic + numeric** - derive stability conditions analytically
- **Built-in Laplace transforms** - no manual implementation
- **Parametric analysis** - how does stability region change with parameters?
- **Visualization** - root locus, Bode, Nyquist in one-liners

**Comparison with alternatives** - see `/docs/sessions/session-2025-11-19.md` for detailed discussion.

## Structure

- `docs/` - Discussion notes, derivations, findings
- `scripts/` - Wolfram Language implementations
- `README.md` - This file

## Current Status

**Active exploration** - informal Q&A to understand requirements and scope.

See `docs/sessions/session-2025-11-19.md` for ongoing discussion.
